Configuring for Dual Boot using unaltered MBR from Win7 install

after installing grub onto your linux partition it should look something like:

sudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/LINUX /dev/sda3

Use dd to write the first 512 bytes of your Linux partition to a file on your windows 7 "C partition" that should look something like this:

dd if=/dev/sda3 of=/media/WINDOS7/linux.bin bs=512 count=1

Then copy this file onto your Windows 7 partition and continue the rest of this guide ther

Reboot to Windows 7 next, use BCDEdit to add an entry to Windows 7’s BCD store. Administrative privileges are required to use BCDEdit, so navigate to Start->All Programs->Accessories, Right-click on Command Prompt and select “Run as administrator.” Okay, now let’s start by creating an entry for our Linux distribution. Note here that you are free to choose another entry name if desired:

bcdedit /create /d Linux /application BOOTSECTOR
BCDEdit will return an alphanumeric identifier for this entry that I will refer to as {ID} in the remaining steps. You’ll need to replace {ID} by the actual returned identifier. An example of {ID} is {d7294d4e-9837-11de-99ac-f3f3a79e3e93}. Next, let’s specify which partition hosts a copy of the linux.bin file:

bcdedit /set {ID} device partition=c:
The path to our linux.bin file:

bcdedit /set {ID} path /linux.bin
An entry to the displayed menu at boot time:

bcdedit /displayorder {ID} /addlast
and finally, let’s specify how long the menu choices will be displayed:

bcdedit /timeout 30
That’s it! Now reboot and you will be presented with menu where you can choose to boot to Windows 7 or Linux. When you choose Linux, you’ll be taken to the GRUB menu where you can choose to continue booting your Linux distribution or return to the previous menu.

On a final note, if at any time you want to eliminate the Linux menu option simply delete the BCD store entry you created using the following command:

bcdedit /delete {ID}

===================================================================================================
basically it should look like this:

bcdedit /create /d Linux /application BOOTSECTOR
The entry {12345} was successfully created.
bcdedit /set {12345} device partition=c:
bcdedit /set {12345} path /linux.bin
bcdedit /displayorder {12345} /addlast
bcdedit /timeout 3
